\section{Introduction}

Simply typed lambda calculus (STLC) has been well documented and studied by type theorists and mathematicians, and it's features have been used by many programming languages [NEED REFERENCE].

In \cite{BarendregtHenk2013Lcwt} it is noted that \say{Research monographs on dependent and inductive types are lacking.} This will essentially be one of the goals of this thesis, to provide a guide for mathematicians and computer scientists about the use of dependent type theory. As this doument is written there is no single account of all approaches to \i{dependent} type theory.


%Roughly a \textit{type system} is a set of loosely organised rules outlining how ``atomic sentences'' called \textit{judgements} can be derived from each other in a given context. A \textit{context} can simply be thought of as a list of terms.
