\section{Introduction}

Simply typed lambda calculus (STLC) has been well documented and studied by type theorists and mathematicians, and it's features have been used by many programming languages [NEED REFERENCE].

In \cite{BarendregtHenk2013Lcwt} it is noted that \say{Research monographs on dependent and inductive types are lacking.} This will essentially be one of the goals of this thesis, to provide a guide for mathematicians and computer scientists about the use of dependent type theory. As this doument is written there is no single account of all approaches to \i{dependent} type theory.

Awodey \cite{2014arXiv1406.3219A} made an observation that Dybjer's \cite{dybjer1996} categories with families (CwF) is a presheaf category with a representable natural transformation (it's fibers are representable). He then proceeds to show conditions needed to model a dependent type theory with $\Pi$, $\Sigma$ and $\mathrm{Id}$ types.


This thesis will have three main goals.

\begin{enumitem}
	\item To present a dependent type theory
	\item To model the semantics of such a type theory using categorical methods
	\item To discuss the applications to mathematics and computer science (proof assistants, programming languages and foundations)
\end{enumitem}

Finally we may also discuss recent developments of something called "Homotopy type theory" and how that fits into the general picture.

%Roughly a \textit{type system} is a set of loosely organised rules outlining how ``atomic sentences'' called \textit{judgements} can be derived from each other in a given context. A \textit{context} can simply be thought of as a list of terms.
