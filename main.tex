\title{Introduction to dependent type theory}
\author{Ali Caglayan}

%
%   Plan for writing this document
%  
%   1. Complete bibliography and use
%   2. Introduce simply typed lambda calculus (similar in style to the way John wrote it for his course notes)
%   3. Lay out general outline of how new types are added
%   4. Talk about different ways to introduce dependent types
%   5. introduce universes
%   6. Prefer the type families/univereses approach
%   7. Talk about type families
%   8. Introduce Pi types
%   9. Examples of Pi types
%   10. Introduce Sigma types
%   11. Examples of Sigma types
%   12. How they interact together
%   13. Relationship with logic
%   14. Curry-Howard correspondance
%   15. Inductive types
%   16. Examples, uses, general syntax, implementation (W-types)
%   17. Identity types
%   18. Discuss the induction principle on the identity type and axiom K etc.
%   19. Consider no restriction of axiom K
%   20. Give Identity type as inductive definition
%   21. Say that what we have now is Martin-Lof intensional type theory, reference all these papers about its semantics
% ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Experimental territory / Could be a masters? ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
%   22. Consider functional extensionality
%   23. Consider univalence with examples
%   24. Introduce higher inductive types
%   25. Examples of HITs with reference to semantics by Schulman-Lumsdaine
%   26. Discuss HoTT, what has been done (in algebraic topology etc.) its usefulness as a language for mathematics
%   27. Category theory in HoTT
%   28. Survey of snythetic homotopy theory
%   the list goes on...

%\section{Introduction}

%Roughly a \textit{type system} is a set of loosely organised rules outlining how ``atomic sentences'' called \textit{judgements} can be derived from each other in a given context. A \textit{context} can simply be thought of as a list of terms.
