abstract="We introduce categories with families as a new notion of model for a basic framework of dependent types. This notion is close to ordinary syntax and yet has a clean categorical description. We also present categories with families as a generalized algebraic theory. Then we define categories with families formally in Martin-L{\"o}f's intensional intuitionistic type theory. Finally, we discuss the coherence problem for these internal categories with families.",
